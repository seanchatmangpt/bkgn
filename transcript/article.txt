5.4. Case Study: LongForm QA
5.4.1. TASK & METRICS
In this task, we build on the multi-hop QA (Section 5.3) task by expecting long-form answers to questions that in- clude citations to referenced context.
Figure 2 shows an implementation of this task in DSPy. As shown, it is nearly identical to Figure 1 outside of the in- troduction of a new dspy.ChainOfThought module that gen- erates cited paragraphs referencing the retrieved context. With this task and LM pipeline, we aim not just to produce accurate answers but to generate well-structured long-form answers that are faithful to the retrieved context.
We assess intrinsic performance using asophisticated met- ric, Citation Faithfulness. In this metric, a small DSPy pro- gram uses the LM to check if the text preceding each ci- tation appropriately supports the cited context. Our check outputs a boolean for faithfulness, which is then averaged across the citations in the output to aggregate a metric for evaluation. As extrinsic metrics, we use: (1) Answer Cor- rectness, verifying if the gold answer is correctly incorpo- rated; (2) Citation Precision, gauging the proportion of cor- rectly cited titles; and (3) Citation Recall, measuring the
coverage of gold titles cited. 5.4.2. CONSTRAINTS SPECIFIED
We introduce more complex suggestions here, unlike in Section 5.3. As a simple initial check, we include a Suggest statement that requires every 1–2 of sentences generated has citations in an intended format. This is checked by a simple Python function citations_check. As a more so- phisticated check, we Suggest that the text preceding any citation must be faithful to the cited context, ensuring that the reference text accurately represents the content of the cited information. Since this is a fuzzy condition, we em- ploy a small DSPy program (one that uses the LM) to per- form this check. Notably, the robust API design of Suggest allows the user to specify arbitrary expressions as condi- tional checks, such as an LM call. The goal of this Suggest statement is to ensure that all sentences are appropriately
attributed to correct supporting sources.
5.4.3. EVALUATION
We extend our analysis to the LongFormQA task to un- derstand how different configurations impact the quality of generated paragraphs with citations to answer questions in terms of citation faithfulness, recall, precision, and answer correctness. We employ a similar evaluation methodology used in the MultiHopQA evaluation (5.3.3).
We start with the simplest baseline: LongFormQA in a zero-shot, uncompiled configuration (ZeroShot– NoSuggest). Introducing assertions in this zero-shot setting (ZeroShot–Suggest) yields a highly significant ≈16.7% improvement on the intrinsic citation faithfulness metric, indicating the effect of imposed constraints in main- taining proper citation formatting and referencing. Further- more, we also observe gains across all extrinsic metrics– recall, precision, and correctness–reflecting the value of ef- fective citation inclusion in enhancing the overall quality of the generated paragraphs in providing composite answers.
Again, we explore enhancements by compiling with few- shot examples in DSPy using a random search (Sec-

DSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Refining Language Model Pipelines
 Table 2. Evaluation of LongFormQA with Citations Task. This table covers a comparative analysis across different strate- gies, including ZeroShot (uncompiled) and FewShot (includes few-shot example demonstrations, compiled with DSPy’s BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch teleprompter), both with and without assertions (NoSuggest and Suggest). Metrics measured are Citation Faithfulness, Citation Recall, Citation Precision, and Answer Correctness (Section 5.4.1)

 tion 5.3.3). In the non-assertion configuration (FewShot– NoSuggest), we observe a performance improvement across metrics as the few-shot demonstrations further re- fine information retrieval and citations. When including as- sertions (FewShot–Suggest), we continue to see notable gains of ≈11.2% in citation faithfulness. However, we do see a decline in recall and precision, reflecting some com- plex interplay between adherence to LM Assertions and optimizing few-shot examples for answer correctness. Yet we observe that introducing computational constraints does not decrease performance on the fundamental downstream metric of answer correctness.
6. Related Work
6.1. Programming with Constraints
Programming with constraints is standard in most programming languages. Popular programming lan- guages like Java (Bartetzko et al., 2001) or Python (Python Software Foundation, 2023) all support express- ing assertions as first-class statements to perform runtime checks of certain properties.
However, most runtime checks can only be used to warn the programmer or abort the execution early. Kang et al. (2020) proposed a concept called model assertion, which can be used to monitor the behavior of machine learning models and to improve the quality of a model in training through data collection. However, among the key differ- ences in our work is that LM Assertions abstract automatic self-refinement on violating the assertions. Our Assert and Suggest constructs can backtrack an LM pipeline to retry a failing module. On retry, additional information and feed- back are automatically injected into the prompt, guiding the LM program to make better predictions to pass assertions eventually. As described in Sec 5, LM Assertions can addi- tionally be used to inform improved compilation of DSPy programs, though we leave fully specifying and testing this to future versions of our report.
6.2. Self-Refinement and Correction
9
51.8% 59.4% 56.3% 64.8% 62.8% 75.3% 62.5% 73.8%
 By integrating Python-style assertions, we ensure pro- grammers can clearly express computational constraints on DSPy programs and assert desired program behavior. These declarative constraints can then be leveraged by the DSPy compiler and runtime in extensible and powerful ways to abstract and generalize notions of self-refinement and DSPy’s capabilities for prompt optimization. We re- port on initial evaluation of an implementation that does so in this work. Such self-refinement of LLMs (Madaan et al., 2023; Shridhar et al., 2023) is central to this approach in making DSPy autonomous and context-aware (Tyen et al., 2023). Enforcing methodologies of iterative refinement us- ing error feedback (Xu et al., 2023) and utilizing reasoning capabilities through presenting past generations and feed- back for correction (Qiu et al., 2023) resonates with the ob- jective of DSPy assertions.
6.3. Program Synthesis and Sketching
Classical program synthesis generates programs based on a given specification, involving a search for can- didate programs that match the specification’s struc- ture (Pnueli & Rosner, 1989; Gulwani et al., 2017). In this space, particularly relevant to our work are ap- proaches such as Sketching (Solar-Lezama, 2008) and Template-based synthesis (Srivastavaetal., 2013). In sketching (Solar-Lezama, 2009), the programmer speci- fies a high-level structure (“sketch”) with placeholders (“holes”) for the synthesis engine to complete. The sketch includes assertions, and the correctness requirement is that these assertions hold for all inputs within the bound spec- ified by the synthesizer. We note that the specification as- sertions in Sketching correspond to the proposed LM As- sertions (Assert and Suggest). Similarly, a synthesizer par- allels an LM pipeline framework, like the DSPy compiler, striving to compile an optimized prompt.

DSPy Assertions: Computational Constraints for Self-Refining Language Model Pipelines
 6.4. Factual Consistency and Citations
This work evaluates LM Assertions on long-form paragraph generation with citations to answer ques- tions (Gao et al., 2023). This task is inspired by several studies with the objective of ensuring factual consistency and citation quality from LLM outputs. Existing frame- works (Min et al., 2023) highlight the complexity of eval- uating factual faithfulness in natural language generation. Proposed methodologies like TrueTeacher (Gekhman et al., 2023) and Chain-of-Verification (Dhuliawala et al., 2023) demonstrate LLM-based factual consistency evaluations, which align with the assertion-based methodology in DSPy for ensuring text-to-citation faithfulness. Furthermore, benchmarks for automatic attribution evaluation (Yue et al., 2023) and verifying citations for text generations reflect di- rect applications for the motivation of this paper, focused on showing the efficacy of asserting the presence and re- spective accuracy of citing references.
7. Conclusion
We have introduced LM Assertions, a new construct for expressing arbitrary computational constraints on the behavior of LMs when used as building blocks of larger programs. We integrate LM Assertions into the DSPy (Khattab et al., 2023) programming model, define runtime retry semantics, and an implementation for them that abstracts and generalizes LM self-refinement ap- proaches to arbitrary steps in arbitrary pipelines. We also discuss several other mechanisms that our LM Assertion constructs can use to inform DSPy compilation into higher- quality prompts that reduce the assertion failure rates. Our evaluations show substantial gains on two case studies, re- porting both intrinsic (i.e., assertion-specific) and extrinsic (i.e., downstream) task metrics. By enabling DSPy pro- grams to autonomously backtrack and self-correct, we hope we have opened avenues for building more reliable LM pro- grams at higher levels of abstraction than was previously possible.

# Personalized Marketing Automation with DSPy Segmentation

In today's digital age, personalized marketing isn't just a luxury—it's what customers expect. Utilizing DSPy for personalized marketing automation allows businesses to analyze vast amounts of data to understand customer preferences, behaviors, and demographic information. This understanding is crucial for creating highly targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with the audience, ultimately leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.

## Understanding DSPy Segmentation

Segmentation in DSPy involves dividing a customer base into distinct groups that have common characteristics. This is done through advanced data analysis and machine learning algorithms that can parse through customer data to identify patterns and groupings. These segments can then be targeted with tailored marketing campaigns that meet the specific needs and preferences of each group.

### Benefits of DSPy Segmentation

- **Increased Engagement:** Personalized content is more relevant to the audience, leading to higher engagement rates.
- **Enhanced Customer Satisfaction:** Customers receive content that is relevant to them, improving their overall satisfaction with your brand.
- **Higher Conversion Rates:** Tailored campaigns are more likely to resonate with customers, leading to higher conversion rates.
- **Efficient Use of Marketing Resources:** By focusing on segments that are more likely to convert, companies can allocate their marketing resources more effectively.

## Implementing DSPy for Personalized Marketing

The implementation of DSPy for personalized marketing involves several steps, from data collection to the execution of segmented campaigns. Here’s a breakdown:

### 1. Data Collection and Analysis

Collect customer data from various touchpoints such as social media interactions, website visits, and transaction history. Analyze this data to understand customer behaviors, preferences, and purchasing patterns.

### 2. Customer Segmentation

Use DSPy to segment the customer base into distinct groups based on the analysis. Common segmentation criteria include demographic information, purchasing behavior, and engagement levels.

### 3. Campaign Creation

For each segment, create personalized marketing campaigns that cater to the preferences and behaviors of that group. This could involve tailored email marketing, customized promotions, or personalized product recommendations.

### 4. Execution and Monitoring

Launch the campaigns and closely monitor their performance. DSPy can help automate this process by providing real-time analytics and insights into campaign effectiveness.

### 5. Optimization

Use the insights gained from campaign monitoring to refine and optimize future campaigns. This could involve adjusting the segmentation criteria, personalizing the content further, or reallocating resources to more successful segments.

## Case Study: Using DSPy Segmentation for an Online Retailer

An online retailer implemented DSPy segmentation to personalize their marketing efforts. They analyzed customer data to create segments based on purchasing behavior and interests. Tailored email campaigns were then sent out, offering personalized promotions and product recommendations.

**Results:**

- The click-through rate for emails increased by 25%.
- Conversion rates from the targeted campaigns saw a 15% increase.
- Customer satisfaction scores improved, with a 20% increase in positive feedback.

## Conclusion

Personalized marketing automation with DSPy segmentation offers a powerful way to connect with customers on a more personal level. By understanding customer preferences and behaviors, businesses can create highly targeted campaigns that not only increase engagement and conversion rates but also enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty. As technology evolves, the capabilities of DSPy in personalized marketing will only expand, offering even more opportunities for businesses to grow their relationships with customers.
This chapter provides an overview of how DSPy segmentation can be used for personalized marketing automation, illustrating the process from data collection to campaign optimization, and exemplifying its application with a case study.

Personalized Marketing Automation with DSPy Segmentation
In the realm of digital marketing, achieving a personalized experience for each customer is the pinnacle of customer engagement and satisfaction. The implementation of personalized marketing automation, using the Domain Specific Language (DSL) as defined in the DSPyGen framework, offers a methodical approach akin to the architectural patterns described in "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture" by Martin Fowler. This chapter outlines the pattern for implementing personalized marketing automation within an enterprise using the DSPyGen DSL.

Pattern Name and Classification
Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern

Classified under Behavioral Patterns for its focus on the behavior of data-driven marketing processes.

Intent
To automate the process of creating and delivering personalized marketing messages and campaigns to different segments of a customer base, by leveraging the DSPyGen DSL for segmentation, analysis, and action execution.

Also Known As
Targeted Marketing Automation
Customer Segmentation Pattern
Motivation
In an environment where customer data is abundant yet underutilized, there exists a significant opportunity to enhance marketing efforts through personalization. Traditional, broad-spectrum marketing approaches often fail to engage customers at a personal level, leading to missed opportunities and inefficiency in marketing spend. The Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern seeks to rectify this by employing a structured approach to dissect customer data, identify meaningful segments, and tailor marketing actions accordingly.

Applicability
Use the Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern when:

You have access to rich customer data across various touchpoints.
There is a need to improve engagement, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction through personalized marketing.
You aim to utilize marketing resources more efficiently by targeting high-opportunity customer segments.
Structure
The pattern utilizes three primary components defined within the DSPyGen DSL, which are orchestrated to implement personalized marketing automation:

Segmentation Module: Analyzes customer data to identify distinct segments based on behavior, preferences, and demographics.
Campaign Generation Module: Creates personalized marketing campaigns tailored to the characteristics of each identified segment.
Evaluation Module: Measures the effectiveness of each campaign in real-time, providing insights for continuous optimization.
The DSL for implementing these components can be referenced in the book's GitHub repository, providing a template for integrating this pattern into your DSPyGen pipeline.

Participants
Data Sources: Customer databases, interaction logs, and external data providing input for segmentation.
Segmentation Engine: The core analytical component that processes input data to delineate customer segments.
Marketing Automation System: Utilizes the output from the Segmentation Engine to create and dispatch personalized marketing messages.
Evaluation and Feedback System: Collects campaign performance data and feeds it back into the system for optimization.
Collaborations
The Segmentation Engine collaborates with Data Sources to ingest and analyze customer data, forming distinct segments. These segments are then passed to the Marketing Automation System to create personalized campaigns, which are evaluated post-delivery by the Evaluation and Feedback System. Insights from the evaluation influence future segmentation and campaign strategies, forming a feedback loop.

Consequences
The Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern offers several benefits, including enhanced customer engagement, improved conversion rates, and efficient use of marketing resources. However, it requires a sophisticated setup to integrate diverse data sources and manage the automation pipeline effectively.

Implementation
Implementing this pattern involves setting up the DSPyGen environment, defining the DSL for each component of the pattern, and integrating with existing marketing and data infrastructure. Detailed steps and the DSL definitions can be found in the book's GitHub repository.

Known Uses
Several enterprises have successfully implemented the Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern to revitalize their marketing strategies. Examples include e-commerce platforms using customer purchase history for segmentation, and service providers personalizing communications based on usage patterns.

Related Patterns
Data Lake Pattern: Often employed to aggregate and manage the diverse data sources required for customer segmentation.
Feedback Loop Pattern: Enhances the Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern by incorporating campaign performance feedback into continuous improvement processes.
Conclusion
The Segmented Marketing Automation Pattern represents a structured approach to leveraging customer data for personalized marketing. By following the guidelines and utilizing the DSL as outlined in the DSPyGen framework, enterprises can achieve a higher degree of marketing precision and effectiveness, ultimately leading to better customer relationships and business outcomes.

        :param cache_duration: Duration in seconds for which to cache the data. Default is 3600 seconds (1 hour).
        """
        self.api_endpoint = api_endpoint
        self.headers = headers or {}
        self.cache_duration = cache_duration
